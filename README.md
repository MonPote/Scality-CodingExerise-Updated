### Overview
The Counter App is a simple React application that allows users to increment a counter, reset it, and set a threshold value. The app also highlights the counter if its value is a Fibonacci number and displays toast notifications when the counter approaches or exceeds the threshold.

### Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main components:

**App.jsx**: The main application component that orchestrates the display and interaction of other components.

**Counter.jsx**: Responsible for displaying the counter, Fibonacci highlighting, and handling counter-related functionalities.

**ThresholdInput.jsx**: Manages the input field for setting the threshold value.

### Functionality

- Users can increment the counter using the "Increase" button.
* The counter's value and the Fibonacci logo are highlighted if it's a Fibonacci number.
+ Toast notifications are displayed when the counter approaches or exceeds the threshold.
- Users can set a threshold value using the input field.
* The "Reset" button resets the counter and unlocks it if locked due to exceeding the threshold.


This project utilizes a third-party library: `react-toastify` to display toast notifications.
